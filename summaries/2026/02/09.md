# Activity Summary for 2/9/2026

## 5:13:55 PM
The changes log details the evolution of a Python script, primarily `c:\Users\USER\Desktop\sp.py`, designed for extracting random frames from video files, and the introduction of a utility script, `c:\Users\USER\Desktop\extracted_frames\temp.py`.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\USER\Desktop\sp.py`**:
    *   **2/9/2026, 2:13:40 PM**: The script started as a basic `extract_random_frames` function. It used `cv2` to open a video, create an output directory, and then loop to `cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_POS_FRAMES, target_frame)` based on a random gap (`min_gap=5`, `max_gap=12`) to save frames as `frame_XXXXX.jpg`. The default video was `'your_video.mp4'`.
    *   **2/9/2026, 2:14:15 PM - 2:33:04 PM**: A minor update changed the `VIDEO_FILE` constant from `'your_video.mp4'` to `'v1.mp4'`. The core logic remained unchanged across these timestamps.
    *   **2/9/2026, 2:35:03 PM**: This marked a significant refactoring.
        *   The `extract_random_frames` function was greatly enhanced with type hints, a comprehensive docstring, input validation, and improved directory handling using `pathlib.Path`.
        *   It gained additional parameters: `quality`, `max_frames`, and `verbose`.
        *   Detailed video information (resolution, FPS, total frames, duration) and extraction progress (frames/sec) were added to the verbose output.
        *   Frame filenames were updated to a 6-digit format (`frame_XXXXXX.jpg`), and JPEG quality could be specified during saving.
        *   A new function, `get_video_info`, was introduced to fetch video metadata without extraction.
        *   The script was structured with an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to preview video info and then call the extraction function with more control parameters.
    *   **2/9/2026, 3:47:43 PM - 3:55:53 PM**: A series of minor adjustments to the `VIDEO_FILE` variable in the `__main__` block (e.g., `'v1.mp4'` to `'0.mp4'`, then to `'1.mp4'`) and tuning of `min_gap` and `max_gap` parameters for `extract_random_frames` (e.g., from `(5, 12)` to `(2, 10)`, then back, then to `(10, 20)`, and finally to `(15, 35)`).
    *   **2/9/2026, 3:57:08 PM**: Another major functional change.
        *   The primary extraction function was renamed to `extract_random_frames_sequential`.
        *   The extraction methodology shifted from `cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_POS_FRAMES, target_frame)` (random seeking) to a sequential reading approach (`cap.read()`) where a `skip_counter` determines when to save a frame after reading a random number of frames. This is generally more efficient for high-frequency frame sampling.
        *   The function now includes internal `import` statements for `cv2`, `random`, `time`, and `pathlib.Path`, which are redundant as they are already at the top of the file.
        *   The verbose output and final statistics reporting were simplified.
        *   The default `min_gap` and `max_gap` parameters within the function definition were updated to `15` and `35`.
    *   **2/9/2026, 3:57:15 PM - 4:11:22 PM**: Throughout this period, the code of `extract_random_frames_sequential` remained stable, but the `VIDEO_FILE` variable in the `__main__` execution block was repeatedly updated to process a series of video files (e.g., `'0.mp4'`, `'1.mp4'`, `'2.mp4'`, `'3.mp4'`, `'4.mp4'`, `'6.mp4'`, `'7.mp4'`, `'8.mp4'`, `'10.mp4'`, `'11.mp4'`, `'12.mp4'`, `'13.mp4'`).

*   **`c:\Users\USER\Desktop\extracted_frames\temp.py`**:
    *   **2/9/2026, 3:53:10 PM**: A new utility script was created to rotate images. It iterates through all files in a specified directory (defaults to current directory, likely `extracted_frames`), identifies common image formats (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`, `.webp`), and rotates them 90 degrees clockwise using the Pillow (`PIL`) library. It includes basic error handling for rotation failures.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Continuous Development**: The `sp.py` script underwent continuous development, transitioning from a basic script to a more robust, parameterized, and optimized video frame extraction tool.
*   **Video File Iteration**: A strong pattern is the frequent modification of the `VIDEO_FILE` path in the `__main__` block of `sp.py`, indicating a workflow of processing multiple video files with the same script. This suggests an iterative testing or batch processing approach.
*   **Randomized Sampling**: The core functionality across all versions of `sp.py` revolves around extracting frames at random intervals, evolving from direct frame seeking to sequential reading with random skips.
*   **Verbosity and Diagnostics**: The `sp.py` script consistently includes print statements for progress updates and final statistics, enhancing user feedback during execution.
*   **Image Post-processing**: The introduction of `temp.py` suggests a common need for post-processing the extracted frames, specifically rotation, which implies the source videos might have an incorrect orientation or a specific downstream requirement for rotated images.
