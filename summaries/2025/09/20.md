# Activity Summary for 9/20/2025

## 8:17:07 PM
The Python script `org.schedule.1.py` (last updated 9/20/2025, 7:24:27 PM) processes NPC data extracted from a wiki page.  The code first defines ANSI color codes and maps effects (e.g., "Euphoric," "Lethal") to these colors.  The `parse_npc_data` function extracts customer names and their favorite effects from the raw wiki data (`wiki_data`), handling variations in data formatting.  The `organize_dealer_groups` function then organizes these customers into dealer groups based on shared favorite effects.  The algorithm prioritizes grouping customers with frequently occurring effects and aims for a maximum of 8 customers per group and a limited number of effects per group.  The code uses `collections.OrderedDict` and `collections.Counter` for efficient data manipulation.  Error handling is implemented to account for inconsistencies in the wiki data format, such as missing or incomplete entries. The script's logic focuses on creating balanced dealer groups based on the popularity and overlap of customer preferences.
