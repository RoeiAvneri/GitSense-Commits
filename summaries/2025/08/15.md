# Activity Summary for 8/15/2025

## 10:44:16 PM
The log shows significant updates to the codebase of a Red Dead Redemption 2 multiplayer mod between 9:45 PM and 10:03 PM on August 15, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on player data handling and inventory management.

The file `handler.lua` (multiple timestamps) manages player connection and disconnection events.  It saves player data (honor, level, health, stamina, alive status, inventory, position) to a database upon player disconnect or at intervals.  There's extensive debugging output included. A notable change involves removing the saving of money in the auto-save function.

The `functions.lua` file (multiple timestamps) contains client-side functions for adding and removing items from the inventory via a UI, interacting with a 'core' exports for server-side callbacks, and syncing inventory data.  These functions remained largely unchanged during the logged period, except for potentially being cleaned up.

The `player.lua` file (two timestamps) defines a `Player` class and its `Inventory` sub-class. Key changes involve adding a default money item to new player objects within the  `Player:New` function and subsequent modification to persist the initial money amount to the database. The `Player:Load` function now safely decodes inventory data to handle potential errors.

The `inventory.lua` file (multiple timestamps) contains server-side functions for inventory management.  The primary change in this file was to replace the `CopyPlayerItemsToUI` function with a `GetPlayerItemsFromDB` function,  suggesting a shift from directly copying items to retrieving them from the database. This file handles adding and removing items from the player's inventory, using server-side callbacks and contains an event handler for handling item drops when a ped (non-player character) is killed.


In summary, the code updates reflect improvements in data persistence, error handling, and potentially, performance by fetching inventory data from the database instead of directly copying. The consistent use of callbacks between the client and server, and the focus on data synchronization within the inventory system are recurring patterns.


## 11:44:14 PM
The log shows three entries for the same Lua file (`player.lua`), all within a short time frame (8/15/2025, between 11:06:59 PM and 11:08:03 PM).  The file defines a `Player` class and a nested `Player.Inventory` class for managing player data in a RedM (Red Dead Redemption 2 multiplayer mod) server.  The code interacts with a MySQL database (`exports.ghmattimysql`) to load and save player information, including their level, health, stamina, alive status, inventory items (including money), and position.

Each entry contains the identical code. There are no substantive changes across the three timestamps; the log appears to be recording multiple instances of the same version of the file.  The core functionality involves database interactions using prepared statements for data safety. The inventory system supports adding, removing, and querying items, with special functions for managing money.  The `Player` class includes methods for manipulating player attributes (honor, level, health, stamina, alive status, position) and for managing their persistent data.
