# Activity Summary for 8/21/2025

## 4:01:59 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `handler.lua` file between 3:02 PM and 3:03 PM on August 21, 2025.  The file is a Lua script handling player data within a Red Dead Redemption 2 multiplayer mod.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions:  it uses `onClientResourceStart` to initialize a HUD display showing player money, honor, health, and stamina.  The HUD updates initially, then on pressing the LALT key, and continuously every 500ms for health and stamina.  Health and stamina are also sent to the server via a `TriggerServerEvent`.


The changes primarily involve a comment added to address a "Client console error: failed fetch player HUD" issue.  This comment was added and slightly refined in several consecutive commits between 3:03:16 PM and 3:03:29 PM.  There were also minor inconsistencies in a `RegisterConfig()` call, initially present, then removed, and then added back in commented form, possibly reflecting an ongoing debugging process.  The core logic of the HUD updating and server communication remained unchanged.
