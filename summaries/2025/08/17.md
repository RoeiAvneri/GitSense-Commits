# Activity Summary for 8/17/2025

## 11:51:18 PM
The log shows extensive development on a Red Dead Redemption 2 multiplayer mod's inventory system between 10:51 PM and 11:51 PM on August 17, 2025.  The key changes span several files:

**`functions.lua` (player functions):** This file underwent multiple revisions, primarily focused on enhancing the robustness and efficiency of functions for managing player inventory (adding, removing, retrieving items), money (adding, spending, retrieving), and honor (increasing, reducing, retrieving).  Significant improvements included adding input validation, error handling (using `pcall`), and more descriptive debug messages. The final version also includes batch operations (`AddMultipleItemsToPlayer`, `RemoveMultipleItemsFromPlayer`) for improved performance.  The changes to this file are iterative, with several commits improving error handling and adding logging statements at different DEBUG_LEVELs.

**`player.lua` (player class):** This file, also revised multiple times, defines the player class and its associated inventory management functions.  Updates focused on improving data persistence (loading and saving player data to a MySQL database) and adding robust error handling and validation to various player methods (e.g., `Load`, `Save`, `AddHonor`, `SetHealth`). The final revision uses prepared statements for improved database interaction security and performance. The `Player.Inventory` class's `GetItems` function was simplified by removing unnecessary looping.


**`inventory.lua` (inventory server functions):** This file contains server-side callbacks for inventory synchronization, item addition, and item removal.  A notable change was enhancing the logging of item counts during inventory synchronization for better debugging.  The `reply` in the remove callback was updated to reflect success.


**`functions.lua` (client functions):**  This client-side Lua script managing inventory interactions.  The main updates were improvements in error handling, using a cache (`itemDataCache`) for item data to reduce lookups, and adding timeout protection to the `GetPlayerItems` function.  The final version also features improved debugging messages with enhanced logging and validation.


**`event.lua` (client events):** This client-side script handles events like player joining and ped death.  Improvements include optimized ped tracking with a maximum limit to prevent memory issues, better error handling in player joining events, a debounce mechanism for the TAB key press to prevent rapid inventory toggles, improved command validation, and more informative debug logging with conditional logging based on `core:GetSystemConfig().DEBUG_LEVEL`.


**`script.js` (inventory HTML/JS):** This JavaScript file, underwent a substantial transformation.  Early versions implemented basic inventory manipulation (adding, removing items) with a category selection system and keyboard navigation. The later versions refactor the code into a class (`InventoryManager`) improving code organization, readability, and maintainability. A MutationObserver was added to handle changes in the category selection, ensuring correct display of default items.  The final version uses `dataset` instead of `getAttribute` for improved performance and uses the `class` attribute instead of inline styles for better separation of concerns. The final few commits add the `refreshItems`, `getActiveCategory`, and `filterItemsByCategory` functions for better organization and data management.


**`index.html` (inventory HTML):** This file represents the inventory's UI.  Minimal changes were observed, mainly removing inline JavaScript in the final commit and cleaning up the code for improved structure.


In summary, the development process focused on improving error handling, performance, code organization, and database interaction security across the entire inventory system.  The changes are iterative and demonstrate a commitment to writing more robust and efficient code.
