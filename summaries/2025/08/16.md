# Activity Summary for 8/16/2025

## 12:44:15 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to a Lua script (`functions.lua`) managing player inventory, money, and honor, along with a `Weapons.lua` file defining items and a directory listing showing many image files.

The `functions.lua` file underwent several updates between 12:06 PM and 12:10 PM on August 16, 2025, with minor changes in each revision. These changes involved the addition and refinement of functions for managing player inventory (adding and removing items, getting item details), player money (adding, spending, and retrieving money), and player honor (increasing, reducing, and retrieving honor).  The core functionality remained consistent across these revisions; the primary differences were in function names (e.g., `AddItemToPlayerInventory` was added) and minor code adjustments.  All versions included callbacks for client-server communication related to inventory, money, and honor management.


At 12:28 PM on August 16, 2025, the `Weapons.lua` file was updated to include a more detailed definition of the "alcohol" item, adding fields for `max_amount`, `texture`, `description`, and `category`. A subsequent update at 12:30 PM and 12:30:58 PM showed no changes.


Finally, at 12:43 PM on August 16, 2025, a significant change occurred in `Weapons.lua`.  The `Weapons` table was replaced with an `Items` table, which was structured to hold food and drink items. This table contains numerous entries, each defining an item with its name, maximum amount, texture, and category.  This suggests a major restructuring of how items are handled within the mod, moving from a weapon-centric approach to a more general item management system.  The directory listing at 12:30 PM confirms the existence of many image files corresponding to the items defined in the final version of `Weapons.lua`.
