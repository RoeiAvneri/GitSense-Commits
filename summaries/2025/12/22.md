# Activity Summary for 12/22/2025

## 7:24:43 PM
The provided log details changes to the single file `d:\Workspace\Datasets\Minecraft Screenshots Dataset with Features\models-report.md`, which serves as a model training report.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **12/22/2025, 6:24:39 PM:**
    *   The report initially documented **Model M-005** with an original dataset of 52 images and 15 classes.
    *   **Model M-006** was introduced with an original dataset of 98 images, augmented to 160 images, and 26 classes. Its changes included adding training images, extending object classification to inventory slots, weapons (bow, trident, axe, pickaxe, sword), and food items, and applying 1.05% additive noise.
    *   A subsequent update to **Model M-006** reduced the class count to 25, citing incorrect classes like `health_10`, `health_3_5`, `health_2`, and `dunkey`, along with one incorrect classification. This entry also included a conclusion stating the model struggles with detecting entities (especially the bow), indicating a need for hundreds of additional images for entities and weapons, and anticipating the inclusion of a `Player` class which would require significant data.

*   **12/22/2025, 6:25:02 PM:**
    *   A new report for **Model M-009** was added. Its details (dataset size, class count, specific changes regarding incorrect classes, and conclusion) were identical to the updated M-006 report from the previous timestamp.

*   **12/22/2025, 6:25:14 PM:**
    *   **Model M-007** was added, mirroring the details of M-009 and the updated M-006.

*   **12/22/2025, 6:25:29 PM:**
    *   **Model M-008** was introduced, also with content identical to M-007, M-009, and the updated M-006.

*   **12/22/2025, 6:25:48 PM:**
    *   The "Changes" section for **Model M-008** was updated. The previous note about incorrect classes was replaced with "Added Piglin", while maintaining the 25 classes and the identical conclusion.

*   **12/22/2025, 6:25:59 PM:**
    *   A minor refinement was made to the "Changes" section of **Model M-008**, changing "Added Piglin" to "Added Piglin class.".

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Training Configuration:** All reported models (M-005, M-006, M-007, M-008, M-009) consistently used the Ultralytics YOLOv11x framework, with an image size of 1920x1080, 100 training epochs, automatic batch size and device selection, 100 early stopping patience, and disabled dataset caching. Default Ultralytics settings were generally used.
*   **Standard Dataset Parameters:** For models M-006 (after initial update), M-007, M-008, and M-009, the dataset consistently had an "Original dataset: 98" and "After augmentation: 160" images.
*   **Recurring Conclusion:** The extensive conclusion section regarding the model's struggle with 'bow' detection, the need for hundreds of additional training images (especially for entities and weapons), and the anticipated inclusion of a `Player` class (requiring significant data) was duplicated across M-006 (updated version), M-007, M-008, and M-009.
*   **Class Count Adjustments:** Initially, M-006 had 26 classes, which was later reduced to 25, citing incorrect classes. This 25-class count persisted across subsequent models (M-007, M-008, M-009) before specific class additions like "Piglin" were noted.
