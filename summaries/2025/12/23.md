# Activity Summary for 12/23/2025

## 1:27:02 PM
The log details a series of changes to a single file, `d:\Workspace\Datasets\Minecraft Screenshots Dataset with Features\models-report.md`, over approximately an hour on 12/23/2025. This file serves as a model training report, documenting the development and evaluation of a perception model for Minecraft screenshots using the Ultralytics YOLOv11 framework.

**File-Specific Updates (`models-report.md`):**

The file contains reports for models M-005 through M-009, each outlining training configuration, dataset changes, and performance conclusions.

*   **Initial State (12/23/2025, 12:26:45 PM):**
    *   **M-005:** Started with 52 images and 15 classes, using an image input resolution of `1920 × 1080`.
    *   **M-006:** Expanded the dataset to 98 original images, 160 after augmentation, and 26 classes. Key changes included adding classifications for inventory slots, various weapons (bow, trident, axe, pickaxe, sword), and food items, with 1.05% additive noise data augmentation. Image resolution was `1920 × 1080`.
    *   **M-007:** Maintained similar dataset sizes but adjusted to 25 classes, reflecting corrections of erroneous classes (e.g., `health_10`, `dunkey`) and a single incorrect classification. The conclusion highlighted difficulties in accurately detecting the bow and emphasized the need for several hundred more images, particularly for entities and weapons, and anticipated the future inclusion of a `Player` class. Image resolution was `1920 × 1080`.
    *   **M-008:** Saw a significant dataset increase to 190 original images (308 augmented) and 32 classes. New classes such as Piglin, Ice Bear, Iron Golem, and Pillager were introduced, while some unused classes (food, poison, inventory_poison) were removed. The model showed good recognition of common entities but struggled with certain animals (turtles, cows) and an unexpected failure to detect a "one heart" state, suggesting potential overfitting. The recommendation shifted towards model adjustment (fine-tuning) over merely adding more images. Image resolution was `1920 × 1080`.
    *   **M-009:** Reported the same dataset size and class count as M-008. The "Changes" section was initially incomplete.

*   **Minor Textual Refinements (12/23/2025, 12:26:55 PM to 12:27:26 PM):**
    *   The "Changes" description for M-009 was sequentially updated from "No" to "No change were commite" and finally to "None." The M-009 report remained partially truncated in these entries.

*   **Significant Image Resolution Change (12/23/2025, 12:28:14 PM):**
    *   A major update uniformly changed the `Image size` parameter for models M-005 through M-008 from `1920 × 1080` to `640×480`. M-009's reported image size was briefly and inconsistently set to `192` in this entry.

*   **M-009 Image Resolution Reversion (12/23/2025, 12:28:22 PM):**
    *   Shortly after the preceding change, M-009's `Image size` was updated to `1920x1080`, making it inconsistent with the `640x480` resolution now applied to models M-005-M-008.

*   **Subsequent Consistent State (12/23/2025, 12:28:49 PM to 1:07:38 PM):**
    *   Numerous entries over this period show no further substantive changes to any of the model reports. The image resolution for M-005-M-008 remained `640×480`, while M-009's remained `1920x1080`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Framework:** All reports consistently state that the perception model was trained using the `Ultralytics YOLOv11 framework` with default settings.
*   **Standard Training Parameters:** A table of training parameters is consistently used across all models, listing `Architecture (YOLOv11x)`, `Epochs (100)`, `Batch size (Auto)`, `Device (Auto)`, `Early stopping patience (100)`, and `Dataset cache (Disabled)`. The `Image size` parameter was the only one that underwent changes.
*   **Progressive Dataset Development:** The log shows a clear pattern of dataset growth and refinement, with original image counts increasing from 52 (M-005) to 190 (M-008/M-009) and class numbers increasing from 15 to 32.
*   **Detailed Changelogs and Conclusions:** Each model report features a "Dataset Changelog" with specific modifications (added classes, augmented data, corrections) and a "Conclusion" section that critically assesses model performance and provides recommendations for improvement.
*   **Timestamp Grouping:** The log entries show an initial flurry of distinct content changes followed by a long sequence of identical content, suggesting periods of active development interspersed with minor saves or periods of inactivity.
