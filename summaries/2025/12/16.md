# Activity Summary for 12/16/2025

## 9:20:29 PM
The log details a series of continuous modifications to the `d:\Workspace\Datasets\Minecraft Screenshots Dataset with Features\models-report.md` file between 8:20:16 PM and 8:32:04 PM on December 16, 2025.

Initially, the report contains training configurations for two models, "M-005" and "M-006". Both models are trained using the Ultralytics YOLOv11 framework with identical default parameters: 1920x1080 image size, 100 epochs, auto batch size and device, 100 early stopping patience, and disabled dataset cache. At 8:20:16 PM, neither model had a "Dataset Changelog" section.

The bulk of the changes, occurring between 8:20:58 PM and 8:31:41 PM, are dedicated to progressively building and refining the "Dataset Changelog" for **Model M-006**.
*   Starting at 8:20:58 PM, a "Dataset Changelog" section was introduced for M-006.
*   Through a series of rapid updates until 8:22:33 PM, the changelog text was incrementally written, detailing the addition of new training images, and an expansion of object classification to include the selected inventory slot, various weapons (Bow, Trident, Axe, Pickaxe, Sword), and food items. It also mentioned the addition of "small data augmentation."
*   By 8:23:35 PM, the data augmentation detail was clarified to "Noise of 1.05%".
*   At 8:24:06 PM, the entire changelog description was rewritten into a more formal, coherent paragraph.
*   Further additions at 8:24:40 PM, 8:24:47 PM, and 8:25:14 PM introduced specific dataset sizes: "Current Dataset Size: 98" and "Current Dataset Size (after augmentation): 160".
*   A significant formatting overhaul occurred at 8:25:41 PM, structuring the changelog into Markdown subheadings for "Dataset Size" and "Changes," with bullet points for clarity.
*   The changelog was finalized for M-006 by 8:31:41 PM with the inclusion of "- **Classes Number:** 26".

Finally, at 8:32:04 PM, a "Dataset Changelog" section was introduced for **Model M-005**. This changelog reported an "Original dataset: 52 images" and "Classes Number: 15".

A recurring pattern throughout the log is the consistent reporting of training configurations for object detection using YOLOv11, with identical parameters for both models. The process of incrementally adding and then comprehensively refactoring the "Dataset Changelog" for M-006, followed by the introduction of a similar section for M-005, indicates a structured approach to documenting model development and dataset evolution. The changes highlight an iterative process of dataset expansion, class enrichment (specifically for Minecraft-related items), and the application of minor data augmentation techniques.
